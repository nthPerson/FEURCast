## üöÄ Three Ways to Get Started

### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/robert/FEURCast/gbr_ui_test
python quickstart.py
```
This will:
- Check your Python version
- Install dependencies
- Help you configure your OpenAI API key
- Launch the app

### Option 2: Bash Script
```bash
cd /home/robert/FEURCast/gbr_ui_test
./setup.sh
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup
```bash
cd /home/robert/FEURCast/gbr_ui_test

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure API key
cp .env.example ../.env
nano ../.env  # Edit and add your OpenAI API key

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Demo)
1. ‚úÖ Run `python quickstart.py` to set up
2. ‚úÖ Test the app in both Lite and Pro modes
3. ‚úÖ Read `DEMO_GUIDE.md` for presentation tips
4. ‚úÖ Try the example queries to see how it works

### With Your Team
1. üì± Schedule a team meeting to demo this
2. üí¨ Walk through the UI and features
3. ü§î Discuss what works and what needs changes
4. üìã Decide on MVP scope and role assignments
5. üìÖ Create a project timeline

### Development Path
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)**: Train actual GBR model on real SPLG data
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6)**: Replace simulator.py with real data pipeline
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9)**: Refine UI based on feedback
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 10-11)**: Add additional visualizations
5. **Phase 5 (Week 12)**: Deploy and present

## üìñ Documentation Guide

**For You (to understand the demo):**
‚Üí Start with `README.md`

**For Your Team (before the demo):**
‚Üí Send them `README.md` and `DEMO_GUIDE.md`

**For Presenting (during the demo):**
‚Üí Follow the flow in `DEMO_GUIDE.md`

**For Developers (building the real app):**
‚Üí Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for implementation details

**For Troubleshooting:**
‚Üí Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` if anything breaks

## üé® What the Demo Shows

### Lite Mode
- **Model Prediction Card**: Direction (up/down), expected return, confidence
- **Feature Importance**: Bar chart + top 5 driving factors
- **Price Chart**: 180-day SPLG history with moving averages
- **Educational explanations**: LLM explains what the features mean

### Pro Mode
Everything in Lite, plus:
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Intent Classification**: System understands what you're asking
- **Dynamic Tool Execution**: Fetches data, computes metrics, generates charts
- **Sector Risk Analysis**: Treemap showing volatility by sector
- **Comparative Analytics**: Compare sector performance
- **System Transparency**: See the JSON plan the LLM creates

## üí° Key Talking Points for Your Team

### 1. "This is a skeleton, not a limitation"
> "Everything you see works, but it's using simulated data to demonstrate the architecture. The real version will have trained models and live market data."

### 2. "The LLM is an orchestrator, not a calculator"
> "Notice how the LLM doesn't do math or make predictions. It routes queries, plans tool execution, and explains results. The actual analysis is deterministic Python code."

### 3. "Modularity makes this extensible"
> "See how simulator.py is separate from the UI? We can swap it out function-by-function as we build real components. The interface stays the same."

### 4. "This demonstrates educational value"
> "The explanations, feature importance, and disclaimers show this is a learning tool, not financial advice. That's our project's unique angle."

## üé¨ Demo Script (5-Minute Version)

**Minute 1**: Introduction
- "This is FUREcast, our SPLG analytics dashboard"
- Show sidebar, explain Lite vs Pro modes

**Minute 2**: Lite Mode
- Show prediction card
- Click "Refresh Prediction" to see it change
- Explain feature importance chart

**Minute 3**: Pro Mode
- Type: "Which sectors look stable this quarter?"
- Show how it plans and executes
- Reveal the treemap visualization

**Minute 4**: Architecture
- Open `ARCHITECTURE.md` in editor
- Show the data flow diagram
- Explain the tool-based approach

**Minute 5**: Discussion
- "What should we add/change?"
- "Are we aligned on the GBR approach?"
- "Who wants to work on which component?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### This Demo Uses Simulated Data
- Market prices: Generated with realistic volatility
- GBR predictions: Created by OpenAI mimicking model output
- Risk metrics: Calculated on simulated data

**This is intentional!** It lets you demo the full system before building all the pieces.

### OpenAI API Costs
Very low! Approximately:
- $0.001 per query
- $1/month for 100 users with 10 queries each

### Performance
First load may be slow while OpenAI generates predictions. Subsequent interactions are faster. Production version will cache aggressively.
