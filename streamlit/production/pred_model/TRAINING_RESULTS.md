## Next Steps

1. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/robert/FEURCast/streamlit/production/pred_model
   ./train_and_evaluate.sh
   ```

2. **Review results**: Check `models/metrics.json` and plots in `plots/`

3. **Test predictions**: Run `python predict.py` to verify inference works

4. **Deploy to app**: Restart Streamlit app to use real model

5. **Monitor performance**: Track accuracy on new data over time
